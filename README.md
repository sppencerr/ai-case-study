## HealthWorksAI: Changing Medicare Advantage with AI
### Overview and Origin
HealthWorksAI started in 2019 to make Medicare Advantage data easier to understand and use. The company wanted to help healthcare payors make better decisions faster. While it’s not clear who the founders are, the company is private and hasn’t shared any information about funding.

Their goal is to give payors tools that make the complicated Medicare Advantage system easier to handle. They use AI to turn data into clear, useful information for insurance companies and healthcare providers.
