## HealthWorksAI: Changing Medicare Advantage with AI

### Overview and Origin
HealthWorksAI started in 2019 to make Medicare Advantage data easier to understand and use. The company wanted to help healthcare payors make better decisions faster. While it’s not clear who the founders are, the company is private and hasn’t shared any information about funding.

Their goal is to give payors tools that make the complicated Medicare Advantage system easier to handle. They use AI to turn data into clear, useful information for insurance companies and healthcare providers.

### Business Activities
The company focuses on solving the problem of working with large amounts of Medicare data. They aim to help payors like insurance companies and healthcare providers, who work in a market with over 25 million enrollees.

What makes them different is their simple, easy-to-use AI tools. They also use explainable AI (xAI), which shows clients how decisions are made by their systems. Their technology includes methods like Random Forest and Artificial Neural Networks to process data, and LIME to explain results.

### Landscape
HealthWorksAI works in the healthcare analytics field, focusing on Medicare Advantage. Over the past ten years, this field has seen more companies using AI and tools that explain how decisions are made.

Some of their biggest competitors are ClearDATA and Carta Healthcare. However, HealthWorksAI stands out because they focus mainly on Medicare Advantage, which is a growing and important area in healthcare.
